## Overview

This is an API made to be used with snake-front-end. 

Once the user hits the 'save' button, the coordinates of the head and each tail piece, along with the relevant array of moves that each piece will encounter are sent to the back end. When the user presses 'resume saved game', the data are sent back to the front end to display the snake in the exact same place, heading in the same direction as it was when they saved. 

The food, however, appears as a new piece at random.
